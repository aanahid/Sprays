# About

This is a client-side web application created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses two 3rd party APIs. 

Many video games allow players to use "sprays." Sprays are cosmetic images in video games that are usually applied to map surfaces. This web app enables users to use sprays from Valorant and Fortnite. This is meant to simulate using sprays in a video game. 

When the user clicks on the web page, a spray is chosen arbitrarily and will display in the area where the user clicked. 

## APIs

Both APIs are used to get image paths of the spray to be displayed.
