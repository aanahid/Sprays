# About

This is a client-side web application created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses two 3rd party APIs. 

Many video games allow players to use "sprays." This web app enables users to use sprays from Valorant and Fortnite. 

When the user clicks on the web page, a spray is chosen arbitrarily and will display in the area where the user clicked. 

## APIs

Both APIs are used to get image paths of the spray to be displayed.
